## Set of functions to create and retrieve a special matrix object that can
## store it's inverse.

## object returned from makeCacheMatrix is a list of funtions to set and get
## the matrix, as well as functions to set and get the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    # stored inverse

    # set matrix
    
    # get matrix
    
    # set inverse
    
    # get inverse

    # return list
}

## cacheSolve computes and stores the inverse of a CacheMatrix, or return
## the previously computed result if available.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    
    # get inverse
    
    # if not empty, use cached version
   
    # otherwise, compute inverse and store
    
}
